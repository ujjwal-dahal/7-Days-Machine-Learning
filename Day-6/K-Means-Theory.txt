K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data into groups. It finds patterns in data without needing labeled answers.

How Does K-Means Work?
Choose "K" (Number of Clusters)

We decide how many clusters (groups) we want to divide the data into.
Randomly Place "K" Centroids

The algorithm picks "K" random points as the centers of the clusters. These points are called centroids.
Assign Data Points to the Nearest Centroid

Every data point is assigned to the closest centroid, forming clusters.
Move Centroids to the Center of Assigned Points

The centroids are re-calculated by taking the average position of all points in their cluster.
Repeat Steps 3 & 4 Until Centroids Stop Moving

The process continues until the centroids stop changing, meaning the clusters are stable.
Example
Imagine you have a bunch of fruit in a basket (apples, bananas, oranges) and you want to group them based on size and color. K-Means will automatically form K clusters based on similar features, grouping apples together, bananas together, and so on.

Where is K-Means Used?
Customer Segmentation (Grouping customers by behavior)
Image Compression (Reducing colors in images)
Anomaly Detection (Finding unusual patterns in data)
Document Clustering (Grouping similar articles or texts)
Limitations of K-Means
Needs to know K in advance
Doesn't work well if clusters have different shapes
Sensitive to outliers (unusual data points)
